# Hardware checklist for Ken

Things that cannot be tested in the build sandbox. Filled in as phases go.

## After Phase 1
- [ ] macOS: build and run the macOS tests once after the Phase 1 edits to shared sources
      (`maiden-repl/src/page.c`, `pages.c`, `hardware/screen/ssd1322.h`, `hardware/screen/sdl.cc`,
      `hardware/input/sdl.cc`, `crone/src/BufDiskWorker.h`, `norns/wscript`, `wscript`,
      two unit tests). Expected: no change. (`macos/build.sh`, then the commands in readme-macos.md)
- [ ] Linux, real machine: `linux/setup-deps.sh && linux/build.sh && linux/norns.sh` with real
      audio (`NORNS_JACK_DRIVER=alsa`, jackd or PipeWire-JACK) and a display: window opens, sound.
- [ ] Linux, real machine: `/dev/snd/seq` exists (needed by the Phase 2 "norns keys" port).
