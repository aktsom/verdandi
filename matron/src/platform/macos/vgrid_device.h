/*
 * vgrid_device.h
 *
 * the virtual grid and arc as serial devices: a pseudo terminal that speaks the device side
 * of the mext protocol (vgrid_proto.h). libmonome opens it like a usb grid or arc, so
 * matron's monome code and the scripts see a varibright grid of the chosen size (64, 128
 * or 256), or an arc with 4 rings.
 *
 * libmonome on macOS takes the serial number from the device path (after the first
 * '-'), so the pty is reached through a link <private tmp dir>/grid-m<digits> (arc-m...).
